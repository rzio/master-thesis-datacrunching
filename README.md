Master's Thesis Data-crunching
===========================

The data-crunching code for my M. Sc. thesis
Includes wiki-media's [mwdumper](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MWDumper). I use it to iterate through English wikipedia database dump, and analyze it as if it was a social network.
In my view wikipedia is a type of social network: a crowd-collaborative network, a type of collaborative network, in which contributors collaborate on common goals, without contacting each-other (at least they don't have to).
We're studying such networks, trying to uncover some interesting dynamics.
